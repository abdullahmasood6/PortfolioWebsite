    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p style={{ maxWidth: '720px', margin: '0 auto', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      I’m Abdullah Masood — a soon‑to‑be Computer Science graduate who’s
      fascinated by how thoughtful engineering can improve people’s lives.
      During the day I build security &amp; automation tools at&nbsp;<strong>Gen</strong>;
      by night I tinker with AI agents, Django backends, and React front‑ends.
      I speak six languages and believe clean code is a universal one.
