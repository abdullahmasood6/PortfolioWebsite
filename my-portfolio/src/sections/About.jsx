    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p style={{ maxWidth: '720px', margin: '0 auto', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      I’m Abdullah Masood — a Software Engineer at <strong>Gen</strong>, where I build security and automation tools that help protect millions of users’ identities online.
      <br /><br />
      I work in the Identity & Privacy division, contributing to <strong>Privacy Monitor</strong> — a core product integrated into platforms like LifeLock and ReputationDefender. My focus lies in crafting backend systems that simplify and strengthen digital privacy at scale.
      <br /><br />
      Outside of work, I live for movement and exploration. Whether I’m hitting the gym, playing competitive field hockey, shooting a game of snooker, or planning the next escape, I’m always chasing that next rush. I’ve clocked 1,600+ miles in 3 days, explored 3 cities over a single weekend, and never miss a chance to hit the road and discover something new.
